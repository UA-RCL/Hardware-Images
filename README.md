# Block Design Files

Vivado version used for testing: <b>Vivado 2020.2</b>

To create the Block Design for VC707-RISCV composed of 1 boom RISC-V core, 2 big RISC-V cores and 3 little RISC-V cores and 2 FFT accelerators, run the `generate.sh` script.

Generated Vivado project will be located at [vc707-riscv-release_2cpu_2fft/vc707-riscv-release.xpr](vc707-riscv-release_2cpu_2fft/vc707-riscv-release.xpr)

We modified the block design generated by [vivado-risc-v](https://github.com/eugene-tarassov/vivado-risc-v). Please refer to that repository for further details.
